#### The very basics
We are glad to announce the **first tutorial** of a series of video tutorials about how to use CARLA.

In these videos, we'll try to cover things like modifying the python client examples or how to build CARLA from source. The point of this is to help people that have troubles with our documentation or does not have enough English knowledge to understand it.

In this one, you will see the very basics of how to use one of the releases of CARLA that you can get from [here](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases).

#### More tutorials?
The making of this videos is something really time consuming for us, but we think it is really important for the community to have these extra information.

We'll try our best to add more videos with better content.
