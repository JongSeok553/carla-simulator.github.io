We know, you were probably very
 ansious after almost two months without receiving  new
CARLA releases. But here we are, to fullfill the hunger for data
of your machine learning algorithms. As you probably
saw in the title, CARLA now has bikes and motorbikes !
Also, we present another *major improvement* on
the FPS due to optimizations on CARLA's assets.

The list of new models is vast and includes harley davidsons,
yamahas, ninja kawasakis, scooters, road bycicles and more!
And, as everything else in carla,
 they are free to download, change and redistribute. We would like
  to thank all the  amazing work of our 3D artists for the past months
  on designing and animating these models.



The CARLA 0.8.3 release also adds few other improvements and fixes:


  * Added two-wheeled vehicles, 3 bicycles and 4 motorbikes
  * Several art optimizations (CARLA is now about ???? faster)
    - Improved the performance of trees
    - Drastically reduced the number of polygons of the landscape while keeping the original shape
    - Removed some unnecessary assets
    - Remodelled Mustang and NissanMicra, now with less polygons and materials, better textures and LOD
    - Remodelled building SM_TerracedHouse_01, now with more polygons but less materials and better textures
  * CARLA releases include now a Dockerfile for building docker images
  * Change in HUD: replace "FPS" by "Simulation Step"
  * The current map name is now included in the scene description message sent to the client
  * Adapted "manual_control.py" and "view_start_positions.py" to use the map name sent by the simulator
  * Improved the vehicle spawning algorithm, now it tries to spawn as much cars as possible even if there are not enough spawn points
  * "Setup.sh" is now faster and accepts an argument to run multiple jobs in parallel
  * Fixed foliage distance culling using wrong distance in "Low Mode"
  * Fixed NissanMicra slightly turning left when driving straight
