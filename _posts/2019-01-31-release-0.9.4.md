### Record system

What an exciting moment for Carla, the record system is here! This is a feature that we know most of you were expecting.

This ables you to replay a simulation period of time later on at the desired starting point, and see what happened back in time. The files are stored on the server side, with the name you want. There is also a camera following mode that let you follow an actor while replaying the simulation, so you can replay the same part of the simulation from different points of view. This is, for sure, integrated into the `manual_control.py`. Give it a try!

- `CTRL + R`: Toggle recording (file is always 'manual_recording.rec')
- `CTRL + P`: Replay last recording.
- `CTRL + -`: Subtract 1 second the start time of the replayer.
- `CTRL + =`: Add 1 second the start time of the replayer.
- `CTRL + SHIFT + -`: Subtract 10 seconds the start time of the replayer.
- `CTRL + SHIFT + =`: Add 10 seconds the start time of the replayer.
- Note: A negative time start means to replay from the end of the recording (-2 = replay the last 2 seconds)

There is also a query system where you can ask for some events happened in the recorded file, for example, if any hero actor had any collision with any other (you can filter by type, so you could be warned only for collisions between your hero and any walker). Then you can replay that part in diverse weather conditions, moreover, resume the simulation any time to try to solve the situation.

### Synchronous mode
@todo!

### Importing and exporting maps

## Importing maps from FBX
We've added some scripts to make easier this task. User's can now add the fbx files to a specific folder
and run a script to include the maps to the code project without opening unreal. We even sort them for you
following the rules of semantic segmentation! These maps will already have all the routes, waypoints, nodes,
etc setup in RoadRunner. This tool is located in PythonAPI/util and it is called "generate_map.py".


## Export map to package
Once the maps are finished, you can distribute them easily with a new script that package the contents for you,
ready to be applied to a distribution build.
Just by running 
make export-maps ARGS="--map=/Game/Carla/Maps/AwesomeMap --file=AwesomeMap" 

you will export and package a patch that can be injected into a dist build. The maps will be saved into 
the ExportedMaps folder.

## Import map to distribution build
The file from the previous task can be placed into the "ExportedMaps" folder in the distribution folder,
and (for now only on Linux), you can run ImportMaps.sh and that patch will be applied. It is a simple extracting script,
so you should be able to do it in other OS without much trouble. you can do this without stopping the server.

### Fun with physics

We also added a very cool feature which basically allows users to change the **physics properties** of the vehicles and its wheels on runtime. So if you need to adjust properties like the vehicle's maximum revolutions per minute, steering curve or even disable wheel's steering and more, from now on you will be able to do it!


### No rendering mode

About **No Rendering Mode**, some great changes have been done related to performance and aesthethics of the visualizer! We have significantly improved the framerate and solved the freezing issue when zooming in and out in `Map Mode`. From the visuals perspective, we believe that the visualizer looks way nicer and intuitive than before! We have added more road information such as adding **stop signs** and also that the **traffic light glows** when it affects the hero vehicle in `Hero Mode`. Useful right?


### Lane change availability

Extended the waypoint API with new functions:
- `carla.Waypoint.lane_change`: Returns a `carla.LaneChange`.
- `carla.LaneChange`: A Python enum that tells whether traffic rules allow a lane change.
  + 0: `None`
  + 1: `Right`
  + 2: `Left`
  + 3: `Both`
  + Can be used as a flag e.g.:
    * `LaneChange.Right & LaneChange.None => False`
    * `LaneChange.Right & LaneChange.Left => False`
    * `LaneChange.Right & LaneChange.Both => True`
    * `LaneChange.Right & LaneChange.Right => True`
- `carla.Waypoint.lane_type`: Returns an string that codifies the type of the current lane, i.e.: `"driving", "bidirectional", "shoulder", "sidewalk", "median", "parking", "none", ...`
- `carla.Waypoint.get_right_lane()`: Returns another `carla.Waypoint` (although the rules allow the change or not) at the closest right neighbor lane. If there is no right lane, it returns `None`.
- `carla.Waypoint.get_left_lane()`: Returns another `carla.Waypoint` (although the rules allow the change or not) at the closest left neighbor lane. If there is no left lane, it returns `None`. Notice that if the new waypoint is on a different signed `lane_id`, it does mean that it is in the opposite direction.


### Building on Windows

The Windows build has been highly improved. Now it downloads and installs `libpng` so you can correctly save images from the PythonAPI, that now compiles like a charm.

If you face some issue while running a client Python script, complaining about missing DLL, you just need to compile (or easily find on the Internet) a fresh x64 `zlib.dll`, and put it in `carla\PythonAPI` folder. Sorry for the inconvenience, we'll try to fix this ASAP!

```
Remember!
  Make sure you are using Python3 x64
  Make sure you have Git, Make, CMake, Python in your PATH
  Compile using Visual Studio x64 Native Tools Command Prompt, not cmd!
  Update Visual studio time to time
  Remember to download the assets
```

If you have any troubles with the Windows build, please, join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/8kqACuC) and ask on the `#windows` channel.

### Michigan Left

As usual in Carla, we always explore new ways to test your agents and add variety to our maps. In Town06 we have recreated the Michigan Left intersection, a connexion ramps on/off between two highways, recreated incorporation to a highway, changed several lanes to take different exits and a crossroad with different types of rules.
